An Autonomous AI discord administrative bot.

The AI will be based on Claude models, in particular "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022" and "claude-3-haiku-20240307"

The AI will have access to everything in the joined server, a list of every channel, every role, every user (id, name, and display name) and every message ever sent (they will be retrieved when asked for them)

The AI will have administrative abilities and will be able to execute any kind of code that revolves around the discord ambience, this includes asking for basic stuff es: "@bot create me a nice random role and give it to 3 random persons and Erika"

If the AI receives vague info or weird request it will ask for clarification in order not to execute random crap

The AI must also be able to talk normally, act normally and have nice conversations. if the user sends a text with inside a request for example: "yeah my grandma is a very nice cook.. ah btw can you create me a role called pizza? i like pizza, reminds me of what my grandma used to cook..." The AI will have the conversation and also execute the request

The AI must be completely free, if asked to DM a user it will, if asked to send a random message in 3 random channels it will, if asked to *send a message 10 times every 5 seconds* it will

The AI is free both in actions and time, if asked to do something that requires time, it will still do so.

To do all of this the AI will write and execute its own code on my machine, the ai must be able to do basic imports necessary for every task, this includes calling safe APIs around the internet if requested or required to.


how do we verify that AI will not play bad tricks on my PC and go nuts? we will have another AI (AI1 and AI2). AI2 will monitor every output of AI1, before execution, AI2 will be asked to validate the code of AI1, if it is stupidly dangerous es: (calling weird APIs, Mass destruction of the server or anything like that) AI2 will instantly reject and explain why in short words

all of the information about token, server ID, people to can talk to the bot itself are stored in a JSON file that will be found in the same dir as the program; the file looks like this:

{
    "discord_token": "xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "anthropic_key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "telegram_token": "xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "guild_id": 1443908368539451415,
    "admins": [
        783029509061476403,
        1039618113852952577,
        1361732484093575328,
        1447673330269163752
    ]
}


The AI1 must have a 1H memory for each individual ADMIN, this memory is for discussions, little chats and anything else
The AI will also remember all of its actions, so in case the action wanted to revered it's pretty easy

AI1, WILL not be able to read anything on my pc, nor write

1. Human-in-the-Loop Final Authority

A new manual confirmation layer has been introduced.

If AI2 determines that a script generated by AI1 may be unsafe, ambiguous, irreversible, or potentially abusive, execution is paused immediately and escalated to the project owner via a Telegram bot.

No flagged script can run without explicit human approval.

2. AI2 → Telegram Confirmation Workflow

When escalation is triggered, the Telegram bot sends a structured message containing:

Plain-English Summary
A clear explanation of what the script does, written for humans (no code interpretation required).

Risk Analysis
A concise list of objective risks, such as:

mass or repeated actions

timed or scheduled execution

possible rate-limit issues

multi-user or multi-channel impact

external network usage

Exact Script Snapshot
The full, unmodified Python code generated by AI1, displayed read-only.

If AI2 cannot confidently explain the script’s behavior, the request is automatically escalated.

3. Telegram Decision Controls

The Telegram bot provides fast, explicit controls:

✅ Approve (Run Once)

⛔ Reject

🔁 Approve & Trust This Pattern (optional future whitelist)

📄 View Full Code

If no response is received within a predefined timeout, the request is automatically rejected.

4. Hard Execution Freeze Until Approval

When a script is flagged:

No partial execution is allowed

No background tasks or delayed actions may start

No state changes occur

Execution resumes only after an explicit approval signal from Telegram.

5. Python Execution Model (Updated)

AI1 is allowed to generate Python directly for expressiveness and complex reasoning.

However:

AI1 still has no filesystem access

AI1 cannot read or write local files

Secrets (tokens, keys, IDs) are never exposed to the model

Execution occurs only inside the controlled executor environment

AI2 acts as a reviewer, but final authority belongs to the human operator.

6. AI2 Is Advisory, Not Absolute

AI2 does not silently block behavior.

Instead:

Clear or safe scripts pass automatically

Risky or unclear scripts are escalated

The human operator always has the final decision

This prevents both silent failures and over-restrictive behavior.

7. Fail-Safe Defaults

Ambiguous behavior → escalation

No Telegram response → rejection

Unexplainable code → rejection

Safety favors inaction over accidental damage.

Result:
The system preserves AI freedom and expressiveness while guaranteeing that no potentially harmful behavior can occur without explicit, informed human approval.

if you have any suggestions let me know before making the script
